# init_devices: The names of storage devices on the initiator server.
#               Each device will be assigned to one RocksDB instance for data
#               operations.
# rmi_ports:    The system available ports on the host (the device machine).
#               These ports are used to run RocksDB RIM servers.
#               Each RocksDB RMI server is only responsible for one device,
#               so the number of ports should be the same as the number of DUTs.
#               See https://github.com/ljishen/YCSB/tree/remote-rocksdb/rocksdb

# target_devices: The names of physical devices under test (DUT) on the target
#                 server.
#                 This is required for each host.
#                 CAUTION: ALL DATA on the DUTs will be ERASED!
#
# You first need to config the target hosts ([storage]) and the initiator hosts
# ([rocksdb]) to set up connections of devices using protocols such as iSCSI or
# NVMe-oF.
# Performance statistics will be collected from these hosts.
