# init_devices: The names of storage devices on the initiator server.
#               A device can be a storage partition.
#               Each storage device is assigned to a RocksDB instance for data
#               operations and a RocksDB instance stores data only to one
#               storage device.
#               This is required for each host.
# rmi_ports:    The system available ports on the host (the device machine).
#               These ports are used to run RocksDB RIM servers.
#               Each RocksDB RMI server is only responsible for one device,
#               so the number of ports should be the same as the number of DUTs.
#               See https://github.com/ljishen/YCSB/tree/remote-rocksdb/rocksdb

# target_devices: The names of PHYSICAL PARENT devices under test (DUT) on the
#                 target server.
#                 This is required for each host.
#                 CAUTION: ALL DATA on the DUTs will be ERASED!
#
# You need to config the target hosts ([storage]) and the initiator hosts
# ([rocksdb]) beforehand to set up connections of how the init_devices map to
# the target_devices using protocols such as iSCSI or NVMe-oF.
# Performance statistics will be collected from these hosts.
