# test_devices: The names of devices under test (DUT) on the host machine.
#               This is required for each host.
#               CAUTION: ALL DATA on the DUTs will be ERASED!
# rmi_ports:    The system available ports on the host (the device machine).
#               These ports are used to run RocksDB RIM servers.
#               Each RocksDB RMI server is only responsible for one device,
#               so the number of ports should be the same as the number of DUTs.
#               See https://github.com/ljishen/YCSB/tree/remote-rocksdb/rocksdb
